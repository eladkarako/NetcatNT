a tiny MS-VC6 re-build of Netcat (NT version).  
original version: `hobbit@avian.org`, NT version: `weld@vulnwatch.org`.  
includes few minor tweaks to enable it to run on Windows 10.  
see `readme.txt` for more information.

note: migration from sockets to old school winsocket was a bit funky sometime, but in most cases it works fine.

you can download the exe from the `release/` folder (in the code tree). only x86, no x64 version.
